# We should create a function that ‘findsgrade’ by taking in marks of each subject as parameters calculating total from the parameters(subjects) passed
# calculating the average from the total using if statement to find grade what if I want to get total marks! and average?

#
#     marks = (mathGrade/100) + (englishGrade/100)
#     noOfSubjects = 0
#     avg = marks/2
#     if marks > 0:
#         print("Total marks out of 100 is {}".format(marks))
#         print("Average is {}".format(avg))
#     else:
#         print("Null")

# Write a function called sum_digits that is given an integer num and returns the sum of the digits of num.
