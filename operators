# Types of operators:

    # Arithmetic Operators

# +,-,-,/
# ** used for exponential eg 2 to the power of 3
print(2**3)
# % modulo operator - returns the reminder in a division/after a division
#modulor is used for divisibility tests,to check even and odd numbers
print(10%3)
print(48%2)
print(51%2)
#Task - use modulor operator to check if a year is a leap year

# // floor division - truncates a decimal to a whole number ie does away with the decimal
print(49/2)
print(49//2)

    # Assignment Operators

# = assigns to an identifier
add = 2+2
print(add)
#+=increment operator that can increment by any amount
add += 1
print(add)
#++ increment operator,increments by 1 only
#-= decrement operator, decrements by any amount
add -= 1
print(add)

    # Logical Operators
#and,or,not
print(290>=300 and 70>=60)

    # Comparison Operators

#always yields boolean data type as results
#> greater than
#>= greater than or equals to
#< less than
#<= less than or equals to
#!= not equal to
